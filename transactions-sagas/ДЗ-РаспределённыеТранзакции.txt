Saga Logic
1) Booking Service:
   - generates BookingId (for idempotency)
   - creates BookingSaga (passing Order / Order Data to it)
   - fires BookingCreated
   - Order Id is returned to the client
2) BookingSagaProcessor listens to BookingCreated
BookingService creates BookingSaga
BookingSaga then creates the corresponding Booking.
BookingSage then orchestrates the process and updates the Booking accordingly.
